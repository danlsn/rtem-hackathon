    "### 1. Use Case Description and Demonstration\n",

    "interactions, minimum data schema and necessary API functionalities associated\n",
    "with your use case. Finally, your submission must contain an illustration of\n",
    "your proposed use case using the provided API and existing data records.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "As each day passes, the world is moving closer to a fully electric future. Our\n",
    "modern lifestyles are placing more and more pressure on the electricity grid and\n",
    "downstream energy generators to provide enough power. With Electric Cars and\n",
    "Battery Storage products becoming more prevalent—touting reduced carbon\n",
    "footprints, and energy bills—we are faced with the question, where does our\n",
    "energy come from? If you're trying to produce less greenhouse gases, there's no\n",
    "point charging your car with coal power is there?\n",
    "\n",
    "RealNYCE exists as an extension of the RTEM database, and therefore cannot exist\n",
    "without it. RealNYCE provides insights at the equipment level, calculating\n",
    "carbon emission intensity per unit of electricity as well as providing a\n",
    "breakdown of energy sources. A participating building in the RTEM program will\n",
    "be able to use their RTEM data, supercharged by RealNYCE, to identify and impact\n",
    "long-term trends in their own electricity usage. With long-term data they will\n",
    "be able to create benchmarks for greenhouse gas emissions as a basis for\n",
    "measured, and meaningful change. RealNYCE would work well with a database of\n",
    "just one building, but as the database continues to grow it creates an\n",
    "opportunity to extend the functionality of RealNYCE to compute state-wide\n",
    "benchmarks for emission intensity so building owners can compare their figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "RealNYCE is essentially a data pipeline pulling information from a variety of\n",
    "sources, and performing a series of calculations before returning a new,\n",
    "enhanced dataset. Therefore, RealNYCE requires two main types of actors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Providers: that make the raw data accessible to the Computers.\n",
    "2. Computers: those that process the data from the Providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three principal actors that act as Providers; the U.S. Energy\n",
    "Information Administration (EIA), the New York Independent System Operator (\n",
    "NYISO), as well as the RTEM participants. Open Data from the EIA provides the\n",
    "information necessary to estimate greenhouse gas emissions by fuel type for the\n",
    "State of New York. Open Data from the NYISO provides real-time fuel-mix data for\n",
    "electricity generation, which can be combined with the emission intensity\n",
    "estimates, to calculate average emissions per unit of electricity. The final\n",
    "Provider is the RTEM database, or rather the participating building with an\n",
    "electricity meter measuring power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from the Providers needs to be processed and joined before it has a\n",
    "chance to really shine. On their own the data is informative, but once they're\n",
    "combined you gain the opportunity measure impact and drive change. A complex\n",
    "series of steps must be undertaken by a Computer first to Extract, Transform,\n",
    "and Load the data. This role can be handled by consumer grade hardware, either\n",
    "on-site or in the cloud, and can be set to run at consistent intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum data schema required is simply an Electricity Consumption Meter\n",
    "measured in Kilowatt Hours. However, consumption can be approximated using Power\n",
    "Meters measure in Watts and multiplied by the time period to estimate\n",
    "consumption. In the future, other on-site emissive equipment, such as Boilers\n",
    "and Co-Generation Plants, could also have their emissions estimated and\n",
    "benchmarked against the equivalent amount of electricity required. Further\n",
    "development of RealNYCE could help create a business case for the\n",
    "electrification of building infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary RTEM API functionality is to read building data, and optionally\n",
    "write to a Virtual point. RealNYCE relies on the use of Pandas DataFrames to\n",
    "process the data. The use case functions in five parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather RTEM data for the equipment you are analysing\n",
    "2. Estimate fuel source emission intensity using EIA Open Data\n",
    "3. Using NYISO fuel-mix data and EIA data, calculate average emission intensity\n",
    "4. Join RTEM consumption data with the average emission intensity\n",
    "5. Multiply energy consumption by average emission intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process you are left with \"Grams of CO2\" produced for each time\n",
    "period in the original RTEM consumption data. This can be used as the basis for\n",
    "further analyses and benchmarking. They say \"what gets measured, gets managed\"\n",
    "and with the help of the RTEM database enhanced with RealNYCE, we finally have\n",
    "access to the information we need to bring about meaningful change."

As an example, use cases that demonstrate a more significant impact in growing the RTEM System Market and/or increase the confidence of building owners and operators to adopt an RTEM System will receive a higher score. The judges value technically interesting use cases; however, a high market impact is essential to receiving a high score in this category.\n",
