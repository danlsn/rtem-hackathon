    "your proposed use case using the provided API and existing data records.\n",

    "\n",
    "As each day passes, the world is moving closer to a fully electric future. Our\n",

    "carbon emission intensity per unit of electricity as well as providing a\n",
    "breakdown of energy sources. A participating building in the RTEM program can\n",

    "trends in their own electricity usage. With long-term data users can create\n",
    "benchmarks for greenhouse gas emissions as a basis for measured, and meaningful\n",
    "change. RealNYCE can be used with a database of just one building, but as the\n",
    "database continues to grow it creates an opportunity to extend the functionality\n",
    "of RealNYCE to compute state-wide benchmarks for emission intensity; allowing\n",
    "building owners to compare their data with….\n",
    "\n",
    "RealNYCE is essentially a data pipeline pulling information from a variety of\n",
    "sources, and performing a series of calculations before returning a new,\n",
    "enhanced dataset. Therefore, RealNYCE requires two main types of actors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Providers: that make the raw data accessible to the Computers.\n",
    "2. Computers: those that process the data from the Providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three principal actors that act as Providers; the U.S. Energy\n",
    "Information Administration (EIA), the New York Independent System Operator (\n",
    "NYISO), as well as the RTEM participants. Open Data from the EIA provides the\n",
    "information necessary to estimate greenhouse gas emissions by fuel type for the\n",
    "State of New York. Open Data from the NYISO provides real-time fuel-mix data for\n",
    "electricity generation, which can be combined with the emission intensity\n",
    "estimates, to calculate average emissions per unit of electricity. The final\n",
    "Provider is the RTEM database, or rather the participating building with an\n",
    "electricity meter measuring power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from the Providers needs to be processed and joined before it has a\n",
    "chance to really shine. On their own the data is informative, but once the data\n",
    "sets are combined you gain the opportunity measure impact and drive change. A\n",
    "complex series of steps must be undertaken by a Computer first to Extract,\n",
    "Transform, and Load the data. This role can be handled by consumer grade\n",
    "hardware, either on-site or in the cloud, and can be set to run at consistent\n",
    "intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum data schema required is simply an Electricity Consumption Meter\n",
    "measured in Kilowatt Hours. However, consumption can be approximated using Power\n",
    "Meters measured in Watts, and multiplied by the time period to estimate\n",
    "consumption. In the future, there is potential for emissions other on-site\n",
    "emissive equipment, such as Boilers and Co-Generation Plants, to have their\n",
    "emissions estimated and benchmarked against the equivalent amount of electricity\n",
    "required. Further development of RealNYCE could help create a business case for\n",
    "the electrification of building infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary RTEM API functionality is to read building data, and optionally\n",
    "write to a Virtual point. RealNYCE relies on the use of Pandas DataFrames to\n",
    "process the data. The use case functions in five parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tGather RTEM data for the equipment to be analysed\n",
    "2.\tEstimate fuel source emission intensity using EIA Open Data\n",
    "3.\tUsing NYISO fuel-mix data and EIA data, calculate average emission intensity\n",
    "4.\tJoin RTEM consumption data with the average emission intensity\n",

    "After this process you are left with “Grams of CO2” produced for each time\n",
    "period in the original RTEM consumption data. This can be used as the basis for\n",
    "further analyses and benchmarking. They say “what gets measured, gets managed”\n",
